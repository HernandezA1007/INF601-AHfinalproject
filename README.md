# INF601 Final Project


### This final project focuses on using the Flask framework to create a watch list similar to my mini
project 3 application; the to do list. The application allows the user to create and manage a movie list.
By utilizing the Utelly API to search for movies and shows and adding them to their list. The user registers
and has their own individual account to save their data. The purpose of the project is so the user has all their
movies and shows in one place rather than multiple different streaming platforms and such apps.
